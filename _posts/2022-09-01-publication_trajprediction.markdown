Presents a novel model architecture for multimodal trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, that takes the physical properties of the target and surrounding vehicles into account through a weighted attention module. Achieved the highest results out of the models which use rasterized maps to encode environment information in the NuScenes benchmark.
