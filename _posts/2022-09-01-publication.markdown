Presents a novel model architecture for multimodal trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, which considers the physical properties of the target and surrounding vehicles such as the object class and their physical dimensions through a weighted attention module. Our model has achieved the highest results in the nuScenes trajectory prediction benchmark, out of the models which use rasterized maps to input environment information, while being able to run in real-time, achieving a high inference rate of over 300 FPS.
